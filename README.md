## Overview

Project Showcase is a social network for the tech community, allowing users to easily showcase their skills, experiences and projects, to a network of peers and professionals. 

### MVP
The minimum product of Showcase will pull a new userâ€™s information from GitHub and LinkedIn to create a basic Showcase profile. This is analogous to a personally created website, however, within a connected network.
